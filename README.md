# BetterThemes
A plugin to load editor colour themes in Eclipse. Uses a nice JSON format instead of XML, and has support for variables and CSS colours (using [csscolor4j](https://github.com/silentsoft/csscolor4j)).
Also uses a WeavingHook to work around [Bug 559321 - [Dark Theme] Custom editor background color not properly applied](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=559321).

## TODO
[x] Syntax theming
[ ] UI theming
[ ] Icon theming

Possibly in a separate plugin:

[ ] Smooth scrolling
[ ] Inline search
